<h2>Site Use Scenario</h2>
<p>This functionality of the website will be used to get daily recommendations for small acts of kindness that Wendy can do for strangers.</p>

<h2>Frustrations and Needs</h2>
<p>Wendy feels like the stress of her daily life has caused her to be less intentional in her day-to-day interactions with strangers and finds herself being unintentionally curt. This worries her for two reasons. One reason is that she knows her kids are always observing and learning, and she wants them to learn to be intentional, friendly people. The second is that she wants to do better and put in the effort to be the person she wants to be.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Wendys main goal is to get in the habit of making a point take time each day to be kind to a stranger.</p>
<h2>User Story</h2>
